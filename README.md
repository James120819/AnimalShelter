# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Within my projects, I write programs by organizing my code into organized groups. This might include organizing comments in order to have an understanding of my program, or assigning unique names that would help identify unique specs. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

As a computer scientist, I focus on first understanding the program I am working with and then identifying the problems that I would want to witness within my environments. I believe as developers, when we can open ourselves to listening to the things around us, it could help us develop more effective programs. 

# What do computer scientist do, and why does it matter? 

Computer scientist help formulate real world solutions to from complex technology languages. Technology understanding could be complex, but computer scientist help simplify complex problems. If I were to help a company, I'd focus on designing data systems that focus on in depth organizations and company needs.
